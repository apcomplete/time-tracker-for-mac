Story: Create subprojects (TT-16)
	As a consultant
	I want to create projects within projects
	So that I can see grouped totals for a hierarchy deeper than two levels
	
	Scenario: 
		Given a new document
		
		When a project is created called "Income work"
		And a project is created in project "Income work" called "Piano students"
		And a project is created in project "Income work" called "Recording work"
		And a project is created in project "Income work" called "Church job"
		
		And a task is created in project "Piano students" called "Teach lessons"
		And a task is created in project "Piano students" called "Extra time"
		And a task is created in project "Piano students" called "Write arrangements"
		And a task is created in project "Piano students" called "Correspondence"
		And a task is created in project "Recording work" called "Studio time"
		
		And task "Income work > Piano students > Teach lessons" is selected
		And the timer is run for 10 minutes
		And task "Income work > Piano students > Extra time" is selected
		And the timer is run for 2 minutes
		And task "Income work > Recording work > Studio time" is selected
		And the timer is run for 15 minutes
		
		Then the total time for project "Piano students" is 12 minutes
		And the total time for project "Recording work" is 15 minutes
		And the total time for project "Income work" is 27 minutes
