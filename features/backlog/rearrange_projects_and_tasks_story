Story: Rearrange projects and tasks (TT-17)
	As a consultant
	I want to rearrange the list of projects and tasks
	So that I can organize a large list of projects and tasks in a way that makes sense to me
	
	Scenario: Rearrange projects alphabetically
		Given a new document
		
		When a project is created called "Project A"
		And a project is created called "Project C"
		And a project is created called "Project B"
		And projects a sorted alphabetically
		
		Then the name of project 1 should be "Project A"
		And the name of project 2 should be "Project B"
		And the name of project 3 should be "Project C"
		
	Scenario: Rearrange tasks alphabetically
		Given a new document
		And the document has a project called "New Project"
		
		When a task is created in project 1 called "Task A"
		And a task is created in project 1 called "Task C"
		And a task is created in project 1 called "Task B"
		And the tasks in project 1 are sorted alphabetically
		
		Then the name of task 1 in project 1 should be "Task A"
		And the name of task 2 in project 1 should be "Task B"
		And the name of task 3 in project 1 should be "Task C"
		
	
	Scenario: Rearrange projects
		Given a new document
		And the document has a project called "Project One"
		And the document has a project called "Project Three"
		And the document has a project called "Project Two"
		
		And the project "Project Two" is moved to before project "Project Three"
		
		Then the name of project 1 should be "Project One"
		And the name of project 2 should be "Project Two"
		And the name of project 3 should be "Project Three"
