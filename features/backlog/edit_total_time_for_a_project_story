Story: Edit total time for a project (TT-15)
	As a consultant
	I want to enter the time I spent working on a task
	So that Time Tracker accurately reflects the work I did away from the computer
	
	Scenario: Create a new task with manually-entered time
	
	Scenario: Add time to an existing task
	
	# Is this a real use-case?
	Scenario: Subtract time from an existing task
