This file contains information for developing and testing Time Tracker.

== Release Packaging ==

1. Make sure the version number is updated:
    1a. Update CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION for "All Configurations" in the Project Info.
    1b. Update the "Bundle Version" in Info.plist.
    1c. Update "CFBundleVersion" in InfoPlist.strings.
    1d. Change "Bundle Identifier" in Info.plist back to "com.slooz.timetracker"

2. Update the ChangeLog.txt.

3. Test the code
    3a. Run "rake spec" and verify that there are no errors or failures.
    3b. Run "ruby stories/track_time_story.rb" and verify that there are no
        failures.

4. Build the Time Tracker.zip release file:
    4a. Open the Xcode project.
    4b. Change the "Active Configuration" to "Release".
    4c. Change the "Active Target" to "Release Package".
    4d. Build the target.  This will create "build/Release/Time Tracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).zip".

5. If Sparkle or the release file configuration has been changed, test the auto-update system:
    5a. Install the previous version of Time Tracker.
    5b. Update and post appcast/timetracker-test.xml
    5c. Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.slooz.timetracker.plist and change
        SUFeedURL to the location of timetracker-test.xml  (If the URL contains
        spaces, replace them with "%20".)
    5d. Ensure that the old version of Time Tracker can update to the new version.
    5e. Ensure that the new version of Time Tracker can update to itself.

6. Create appcast/timetracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).html using the information from ChangeLog.txt.

        http://time-tracker-mac.googlecode.com

    9b. Make the new release the featured download http://time-tracker-mac.googlecode.com
    9c. Update iusethis.com
    9d. Update versiontracker.com

10. Tag the release with "v$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)" and push the commit.

== Appcast updates with Sparkle ==

There is a dummy appcast which will alway contain a fake "update" for Time
Tracker.  To use this to test the Sparkle updating, edit Info.plist and change
"SUFeedURL" to point to "timetracker-test.xml" instead of
"timetracker-stable.xml"
