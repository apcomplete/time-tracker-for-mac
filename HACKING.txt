This file contains information for developing and testing Time Tracker.

== Appcast updates with Sparkle ==

There is a dummy appcast which will alway contain a fake "update" for Time
Tracker.  To use this to test the Sparkle updating, edit Info.plist and change
"SUFeedURL" to point to "timetracker-test.xml" instead of
"timetracker-stable.xml"

== Using rooSwitch ==

rooSwitch is a commercial application ($15) that makes it easy to save and swap
application data files.  <http://www.roobasoft.com/rooSwitch/>  The file "Time
Tracker.rooSwitch" contains some sample TimeTracker data that can be used for
testing if you have a copy of rooSwitch.  You should make a local copy of the
rooSwitch file, and open the local copy so that you avoid committing trivial
changes to the rooSwitch file.
